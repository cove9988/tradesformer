Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Download
We'll use yfinance to download historical Forex data.

python
Copy code
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Define the currency pair and period
symbol = 'EURUSD=X'  # EUR/USD exchange rate
start_date = '2022-01-01'
end_date = '2023-01-01'
interval = '5m'  # 5-minute intervals

# Download data
data = yf.download(symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date, interval=interval)
data = data.dropna()
Data Preprocessing
Adding Technical Indicators
We can enhance the data by adding technical indicators using the ta library.

python
Copy code
from ta.volatility import BollingerBands
from ta.trend import MACD, SMAIndicator
from ta.momentum import RSIIndicator

# Calculate indicators
data['SMA'] = SMAIndicator(data['Close'], window=14).sma_indicator()
data['MACD'] = MACD(data['Close']).macd()
data['RSI'] = RSIIndicator(data['Close'], window=14).rsi()

# Bollinger Bands
bb_indicator = BollingerBands(data['Close'])
data['BB_High'] = bb_indicator.bollinger_hband()
data['BB_Low'] = bb_indicator.bollinger_lband()

# Drop NaN values
data = data.dropna()
Feature Engineering
Normalize and prepare the data.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# Select features
features = ['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume', 'SMA', 'MACD', 'RSI', 'BB_High', 'BB_Low']
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
data[features] = scaler.fit_transform(data[features])

# Reset index
data = data.reset_index()
Sequence Preparation
Prepare sequences for the transformer.

python
Copy code
import numpy as np

sequence_length = 12  # Number of past observations to consider

def create_sequences(df, seq_length):
    sequences = []
    for i in range(len(df) - seq_length):
        seq = df.iloc[i:i+seq_length][features].values
        sequences.append(seq)
    return np.array(sequences)

sequences = create_sequences(data, sequence_length)
Building the Transformer Model
Custom Time-Series Transformer
We will create a transformer model tailored for time-series data.

python
Copy code
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class TimeSeriesTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, feature_size, num_heads, num_layers, dropout=0.1):
        super(TimeSeriesTransformer, self).__init__()
        self.model_type = 'Transformer'
        self.positional_encoding = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, sequence_length, feature_size))
        encoder_layer = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(d_model=feature_size, nhead=num_heads, dropout=dropout)
        self.transformer_encoder = nn.TransformerEncoder(encoder_layer, num_layers=num_layers)
        self.decoder = nn.Linear(feature_size, feature_size)
        self.feature_size = feature_size

    def forward(self, src):
        src = src + self.positional_encoding
        output = self.transformer_encoder(src)
        output = self.decoder(output)
        return output[:, -1, :]  # Return the last time step's output
Explanation:
The transformer processes sequences of market data.
We add positional encoding to retain temporal information.
The decoder outputs a representation for the last time step.
Modifying the PPO Agent
Custom Policy with Transformer
We need to create a custom policy network that incorporates the transformer model.

python
Copy code
from stable_baselines3.common.torch_layers import BaseFeaturesExtractor
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
import gym
import torch.nn.functional as F

class CustomCombinedExtractor(BaseFeaturesExtractor):
    def __init__(self, observation_space: gym.spaces.Box, feature_size=64):
        super(CustomCombinedExtractor, self).__init__(observation_space, features_dim=feature_size)
        self.sequence_length = sequence_length
        num_features = observation_space.shape[1]
        self.transformer = TimeSeriesTransformer(
            feature_size=num_features,
            num_heads=4,
            num_layers=2
        )

    def forward(self, observations):
        # observations shape: (batch_size, seq_length, num_features)
        x = self.transformer(observations)
        return x

# Update policy kwargs to use the custom extractor
policy_kwargs = dict(
    features_extractor_class=CustomCombinedExtractor,
    features_extractor_kwargs=dict(feature_size=len(features)),
    net_arch=[dict(pi=[64, 64], vf=[64, 64])],
    activation_fn=nn.ReLU
)
Explanation:
The CustomCombinedExtractor extracts features using the transformer model.
The output is fed into the policy (pi) and value function (vf) networks.
Creating the Custom Gym Environment
Environment Adjustments
We'll adjust the environment to work with sequences and provide data suitable for the transformer.

python
Copy code
class ForexTradingEnv(gym.Env):
    metadata = {'render.modes': ['human']}

    def __init__(self, data, sequence_length):
        super(ForexTradingEnv, self).__init__()
        self.data = data
        self.sequence_length = sequence_length
        self.max_steps = len(self.data) - self.sequence_length - 1
        self.current_step = 0

        self.initial_balance = 10000.0
        self.balance = self.initial_balance
        self.net_worth = self.initial_balance
        self.positions = 0.0
        self.total_profit = 0.0

        # Define action and observation space
        # Actions: 0 = Hold, 1 = Buy, 2 = Sell
        self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(3)

        # Observation space: sequence_length x number of features
        obs_shape = (self.sequence_length, len(features))
        self.observation_space = spaces.Box(low=-np.inf, high=np.inf, shape=obs_shape, dtype=np.float32)

    def reset(self):
        self.balance = self.initial_balance
        self.net_worth = self.initial_balance
        self.positions = 0.0
        self.total_profit = 0.0

        self.current_step = np.random.randint(self.sequence_length, self.max_steps)
        return self._next_observation()

    def _next_observation(self):
        obs = self.data.iloc[self.current_step - self.sequence_length:self.current_step][features].values
        return obs

    def step(self, action):
        done = False
        reward = 0

        current_price = self.data.iloc[self.current_step]['Close']

        # Execute action
        if action == 1:  # Buy
            if self.balance > 0:
                self.positions = self.balance / current_price
                self.balance = 0
        elif action == 2:  # Sell
            if self.positions > 0:
                self.balance = self.positions * current_price
                self.positions = 0

        # Update net worth
        self.net_worth = self.balance + self.positions * current_price

        # Calculate reward as the change in net worth
        reward = self.net_worth - self.initial_balance

        # Move to the next time step
        self.current_step += 1

        if self.current_step >= self.max_steps:
            done = True

        obs = self._next_observation()
        info = {'net_worth': self.net_worth}

        return obs, reward, done, info

    def render(self, mode='human'):
        profit = self.net_worth - self.initial_balance
        print(f'Step: {self.current_step}')
        print(f'Balance: {self.balance:.2f}')
        print(f'Positions: {self.positions:.4f}')
        print(f'Net Worth: {self.net_worth:.2f}')
        print(f'Profit: {profit:.2f}')
Explanation:
The environment now provides sequences of observations suitable for the transformer.
The agent receives a sequence of past observations and decides to hold, buy, or sell.
The reward is the change in net worth.
Training the Hybrid Agent
python
Copy code
import gym
from stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import DummyVecEnv

# Prepare the environment
env = DummyVecEnv([lambda: ForexTradingEnv(data, sequence_length)])

# Initialize the PPO agent
model = PPO('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=1, policy_kwargs=policy_kwargs, tensorboard_log='./ppo_forex_tensorboard/')

# Train the agent
total_timesteps = 100000  # Adjust as needed
model.learn(total_timesteps=total_timesteps)

# Save the model
model.save('ppo_forex_transformer')
Notes:
Adjust total_timesteps based on your computational resources.
TensorBoard logging can help monitor training progress.
Evaluation
python
Copy code
# Load the trained model
model = PPO.load('ppo_forex_transformer')

# Evaluate the agent
env = ForexTradingEnv(data, sequence_length)
obs = env.reset()
done = False

while not done:
    action, _states = model.predict(obs)
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    env.render()
Visualization:
You can collect performance metrics and plot net worth over time.
Implement more sophisticated evaluation by running the agent over multiple episodes and aggregating results.
Conclusion
In this implementation, we've created a hybrid Forex trading agent that combines PPO reinforcement learning with a transformer model:

Transformer Integration: The transformer processes sequences of market data to extract temporal features.
Custom Policy Network: The policy network incorporates the transformer's output to make trading decisions.
Environment Adjustments: The environment provides sequential observations compatible with the transformer's input requirements.
Potential Enhancements:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different transformer configurations (number of layers, heads, etc.).
Feature Engineering: Include additional features such as economic indicators or sentiment analysis.
Risk Management: Incorporate transaction costs, slippage, and risk constraints into the environment and agent.
