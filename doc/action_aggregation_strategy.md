1. Define an Action Series Window
You create a fixed-size sliding window (e.g., 1 hour or N steps) to aggregate action signals. Each step appends the latest action to this window, and you evaluate the aggregate behavior of the actions.

2. Action Aggregation Logic
Count the Frequency: Count the number of buy, sell, and hold signals within the window.
Set a Threshold: Define thresholds for triggering actions. For example:

Execute a buy only if more than 70% of actions in the window are buy.

Execute a sell if more than 70% of actions in the window are sell.

Otherwise, hold.

4. Incorporating into PPO
Modify the PPO reward function to account for aggregated actions instead of raw actions at every step. For example:
Reward consistency of aggregated actions.
Penalize frequent changes in aggregated signals.
In the environment, only open positions based on the aggregated action.
5. Advantages
Noise Reduction: Avoids reacting to random, temporary market fluctuations.
Trend-Based Actions: Focuses on broader trends instead of single-step decisions.
Position Management: Reduces the number of simultaneous positions and makes them more deliberate.
6. Optimizations
Dynamic Window Size: Adjust window size based on volatility or time of day.
Weighted Actions: Give more weight to recent actions in the window.
Include Price Trends: Use additional criteria (e.g., moving averages, RSI) in combination with action aggregation.

Explanation
Dynamic Window Size:

The window size is halved when volatility exceeds the volatility_threshold.
This makes the model more responsive during high volatility.
Weighted Actions:

Recent actions can have higher weights.
Older actions can be given less importance by assigning lower weights.
Price Trends:

A simple moving average difference is used as a trend indicator.
Positive trends favor buy, and negative trends favor sell.

Penalizing frequent changes in aggregated signals and rewarding consistency involves tracking the stability of actions over time and incorporating penalties for frequent changes into the reward system. Here's how you can implement this:

Approach
Track Action Stability:

Maintain a history of aggregated actions.
Count the number of consecutive actions that are the same.
Reset the count when the action changes.
Penalize Changes:

Each time the aggregated action changes (e.g., from "buy" to "sell" or "hold"), apply a penalty.
Reward Consistency:

For every consecutive step with the same action, reward consistency by adding a small positive value to the reward.
Incorporate into PPO Reward:

Modify the reward function to include the penalties and rewards for action stability.

```python 
class ActionStabilityTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.last_action = None
        self.consecutive_count = 0
        self.change_penalty = -1.0  # Penalty for frequent changes
        self.consistency_reward = 0.5  # Reward for consistent actions

    def calculate_stability_reward(self, current_action):
        """Calculate reward/penalty based on action stability."""
        if current_action == self.last_action:
            self.consecutive_count += 1
            reward = self.consistency_reward * self.consecutive_count
        else:
            reward = self.change_penalty
            self.consecutive_count = 1  # Reset the counter for new action

        self.last_action = current_action
        return reward


# Integrate into PPO reward
def calculate_ppo_reward(base_reward, current_action, stability_tracker):
    """Calculate final reward incorporating base reward and stability."""
    stability_reward = stability_tracker.calculate_stability_reward(current_action)
    return base_reward + stability_reward


# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    actions = ["buy", "buy", "sell", "sell", "sell", "hold", "buy", "buy", "sell"]
    base_rewards = [10, 15, 5, 20, 25, -5, 30, 35, 10]  # Example base rewards

    stability_tracker = ActionStabilityTracker()
    total_rewards = []

    for action, base_reward in zip(actions, base_rewards):
        final_reward = calculate_ppo_reward(base_reward, action, stability_tracker)
        total_rewards.append(final_reward)
        print(f"Action: {action}, Base Reward: {base_reward}, Final Reward: {final_reward}")

    print("Total Rewards:", total_rewards)
```
