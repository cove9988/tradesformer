## Key Hyperparameters

Here are the primary hyperparameters you can adjust in your PPO implementation:

1. learning_rate: Controls the step size taken during optimization.
2. gamma: The discount factor, determining the importance of future rewards.
3. gae_lambda: Parameter for Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE).
4. clip_range: The clipping parameter in PPO's objective function.
5. ent_coef: Coefficient for the entropy bonus, encouraging exploration.
6. vf_coef: Coefficient for the value function loss.
7. max_grad_norm: Gradient clipping threshold to prevent exploding gradients.

## Suggested Refinements

### Learning Rate Schedule:

Instead of a fixed learning rate, consider using a learning rate schedule that gradually decreases the learning rate over time.
This can help the agent converge to a better solution.
Example:

```Python
from stable_baselines3.common.callbacks import LearningRateSchedule

def linear_schedule(initial_value: float):
    def func(progress_remaining: float) -> float:
        return progress_remaining * initial_value
    return func

lr_schedule = LearningRateSchedule(linear_schedule(1e-4))  # Start with 1e-4

model = PPO(
    'MlpPolicy',
    env,
    verbose=1,
    policy_kwargs=policy_kwargs,
    learning_rate=lr_schedule,  # Use the schedule
    max_grad_norm=0.5
)
```

### Gamma and GAE Lambda:

Experiment with slightly lower values of gamma (e.g., 0.95 or 0.9) to prioritize shorter-term rewards.
Adjust gae_lambda within the range of 0.9 to 1.0.

### Clip Range:

Try smaller values for clip_range (e.g., 0.1 or 0.2) to restrict the policy updates and improve stability.
Entropy Coefficient:

If the agent is not exploring enough, increase ent_coef slightly.
If the agent is exploring too much and not converging, decrease it.
Value Function Coefficient:

Adjust vf_coef to balance the value function loss with the policy loss.
Batch Size and Mini-Batches:

Experiment with different batch sizes and mini-batch sizes to find a good balance between training stability and speed.
Tuning Process

Start with Default Values: Begin with the default hyperparameters provided by Stable Baselines3.
Prioritize Important Hyperparameters: Focus on tuning the learning rate, gamma, and clip range first, as these tend to have the most significant impact.

Systematic Approach: Change one hyperparameter at a time to isolate its effect.
Monitor Performance: Track the agent's performance during training using metrics like episode rewards, win rate, and average profit/loss.
Experiment and Iterate: Be prepared to experiment with different combinations of hyperparameters to find what works best for your specific trading environment and data.

### Additional Tips

Use a Validation Set: Split your data into training and validation sets to evaluate the agent's performance on unseen data.
Consider Early Stopping: Stop training if the agent's performance on the validation set starts to decrease to prevent overfitting.
Use Grid Search or Other Optimization Techniques: For more advanced tuning, consider using grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to explore the hyperparameter space more efficiently.

Remember that finding the optimal hyperparameters is an iterative process. Be patient, experiment systematically, and carefully monitor the agent's performance to guide your tuning decisions.
